# Redbus_Project
Redbus Data Scraping with Selenium &amp; Dynamic Filtering using Streamlit

This project automates the collection, storage, and visualization of bus travel data from the Redbus website. Using Selenium, data such as routes, route links, bus name, bus type,  schedules, prices, rating and seat availability is scraped and stored in a structured SQL database.

A Streamlit application is developed to display and filter the data interactively. Users can apply filters like bus type, route, price range, star rating, and availability to analyze the data effectively.

Key Features:
1. Data Scraping: Automates extraction of government and private bus details from Redbus.
2. Data Storage: Organizes scraped data in a SQL database for easy retrieval and filtering.
3. Interactive Application: Provides an intuitive Streamlit interface for filtering and visualizing bus data.
4. Filters: Includes options to sort by bus type, routes, prices, ratings, and availability
